    "ai_reasoning": "To create a diamond engagement ring with a flower pattern, the design must incorporate a balance between elegance and manufacturability, adhering to moderate complexity. The ring should feature a central diamond set prominently, surrounded by a flower motif, which can be achieved using prongs and a bezel setting to enhance the design's aesthetics while ensuring structural integrity. This approach allows for a visually appealing design with secure gemstone settings and a detailed floral pattern.",
    "quality_notes": "Ensure that the bezel and prongs are precisely aligned to securely hold the diamond. The high polish finish should be applied uniformly to prevent any surface imperfections. The flower pattern must be consistent and symmetric to maintain aesthetic balance. Thoroughly inspect the prong settings to ensure they are strong enough to hold the diamond securely without any risk of loosening."
