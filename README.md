    radius_outer = params.get('radius_outer', 0.006)  # 6mm outer radius
    radius_inner = params.get('radius_inner', 0.004)  # 4mm inner radius
    height = params.get('height', 0.002)  # 2mm height
    points = 5  # 5-pointed star
    
    # Create star profile vertices with alternating radii
    verts = []
    for i in range(points * 2):  # Outer and inner points
        angle = (i * math.pi) / points
        radius = radius_outer if i % 2 == 0 else radius_inner
        x, y = radius * math.cos(angle), radius * math.sin(angle)
        verts.extend([bm.verts.new((x, y, 0)), bm.verts.new((x, y, height))])
    
    # Create faces to form the star bezel structure
    faces = []
    for i in range(0, len(verts), 2):
        next_i = (i + 2) % len(verts)
        face_verts = [verts[i], verts[i+1], verts[next_i+1], verts[next_i]]
        faces.append(bm.faces.new(face_verts))
    
    bm.faces.ensure_lookup_table()
    return faces
```
