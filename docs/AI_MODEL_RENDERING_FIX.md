# AI Model Rendering Fix

## Issue Summary

The viewport was displaying repeated warnings about static models not being rendered:
```
⚠️ GLB model model_240b800e-a9b6-4dc0-9ed5-18a418714ec3 URL /3d_models/professional_samples/diamond_ring_example.glb is not an AI-generated model, skipping render
```

## Root Cause

The design store was automatically loading a default static model on initialization:
```typescript
setTimeout(() => {
  get().actions.loadGLBModel('/3d_models/professional_samples/diamond_ring_example.glb', 'Diamond Ring')
}, 100)
```

However, the Viewport component was correctly filtering out non-AI-generated models (those not starting with `/output/`) to enforce the AI-first approach.

## Solution

Removed the default static model loading from `designStore.ts` since:
1. The viewport now only renders AI-generated models (URLs starting with `/output/`)
2. Users should generate models via AI or upload their own
3. The static model was causing console spam and confusion

## How It Works Now

### AI-Generated Models ✅
- Generated via the AI chat sidebar
- Stored in `/output/ai_generated/`
- URLs start with `/output/`
- **Automatically rendered** in the viewport

### Uploaded Models ✅ (Future)
- Uploaded via the Model Uploader component
- Stored in `/output/uploaded/`
- URLs start with `/output/`
- **Automatically rendered** in the viewport

### Static Sample Models ❌
- Located in `/3d_models/professional_samples/`
- URLs start with `/3d_models/`
- **Not rendered** in the viewport (by design)
- Used only as training data or reference

## Usage

### Generate a Model
1. Open the AI chat sidebar
2. Enter a prompt like: "Create an elegant engagement ring with a 1.5 carat diamond"
3. The AI generates the model and it appears in the viewport automatically

### Upload a Model (When Implemented)
1. Click the upload button in the toolbar
2. Select a 3D file (.glb, .gltf, .obj, .stl, .3dm, .ply)
3. The model is uploaded and appears in the viewport automatically

## Expected Console Output

After generating a model, you should see:
```

**No more warnings** about static models being skipped! 🎉

## Files Modified

- `frontend/static/src/store/designStore.ts` - Removed default static model loading
- `frontend/static/src/components/Viewport/Viewport.tsx` - Already had correct filtering logic

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner console** - No repeated warnings
2. **AI-first approach** - Focus on AI-generated and uploaded content
3. **Clear separation** - Static models are for training/reference only
4. **Better UX** - Users understand only their generated/uploaded models appear

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Start the application: `python start.py`
2. Generate an AI model via the chat
3. Check the console - should see success messages, no warnings
4. Check the viewport - AI model should be visible and interactive
