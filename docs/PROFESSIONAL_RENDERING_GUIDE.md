# Professional Rendering & Quality Enhancement Guide

## Overview

This guide documents the comprehensive enhancements made to the Aura 3D model generation pipeline to achieve professional, luxury jewelry quality output comparable to high-end design studios like Tiffany & Co., Cartier, and Van Cleef & Arpels.

## Architecture Enhancements

### 1. Frontend Viewport - High-Fidelity Rendering

**Location:** `frontend/static/src/config/featureFlags.ts`

#### Feature Flags Enabled

```typescript
export const featureFlags = {
  enableJewelryMaterialEnhancements: true,    // Professional material rendering
  enableHighFidelityViewportLighting: true,   // 5-light studio setup
  enableAutoFrameOnModelLoad: true,           // Auto-frame camera
  enableBrightGrid: true,                     // Enhanced grid visibility
  disableEnvironmentHDRI: false               // HDRI for realistic reflections
}
```

#### Viewport Lighting Configuration

The viewport now features three professional lighting modes:

**Studio Mode:**
- 5-point professional lighting (Key, Fill, Rim, Top Accent, Side Accent)
- Color-temperature balanced (5000K warm key, 6500K cool fill)
- Enhanced intensities (Key: 2.5, Fill: 1.0, Rim: 0.8)
- Studio environment preset with 4K shadow maps
- ACES Filmic tone mapping

**Realistic Mode:**
- Natural outdoor-style lighting

## Performance Considerations

### Render Times

With the enhanced settings:
- **Preview (256 samples):** ~30-60 seconds
- **Production (1024 samples):** ~2-5 minutes
- **4K turntable (24fps, 360 frames):** ~10-15 minutes

### Optimization Tips

1. **For faster previews:**
   - Use adaptive sampling (already enabled)
   - Reduce to 512 samples for testing
   - Use preview mode in viewport

2. **For production quality:**
   - Keep 1024 samples
   - Enable denoising (already enabled)
   - Use 4K resolution for final renders

3. **For viewport performance:**
   - Toggle to "Safe" mode if needed
   - Reduce HDRI quality if laggy
   - Use "Night" mode for lower lighting overhead

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Materials appear too dark

**Solution:** Check lighting intensity in scene. Ensure all 5 lights are present and not occluded.

### Issue: Depth of field not visible

**Solution:** Ensure `use_depth_of_field: true` in presentation plan. Check camera focus distance.

### Issue: Render too noisy

**Solution:** Increase samples to 2048 for ultra-clean results. Enable denoising.

### Issue: Colors look incorrect

**Solution:** Verify color management is set to Filmic/High Contrast. Check monitor calibration.

## Best Practices

### For AI Prompts

1. **Be descriptive:** "elegant 1.5 carat round brilliant diamond engagement ring in polished 18K gold with refined 6-prong setting"
2. **Specify materials:** Include metal type and finish
3. **Mention details:** Milgrain, filigree, engraving, texture
4. **Reference quality:** "professional", "luxury", "high-end"

### For Materials

1. **Use professional finishes:** "Polished 18K Gold" not "gold"
2. **Specify exact metals:** "Platinum" vs "White Gold" vs "Silver"
3. **Be precise:** "Brushed Platinum" vs "Hammered Rose Gold"

### For Rendering

1. **Enable DoF for jewelry:** Creates professional product photography look
2. **Use studio lighting mode:** Best for jewelry visualization
3. **Test with different angles:** Generate multiple views
4. **Export at 4K:** Higher resolution preserves fine details
