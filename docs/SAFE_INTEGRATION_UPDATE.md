# Safe Integration Update - Preserving Working Viewport

## Overview
This document describes the careful reintegration of upload functionality and metadata tracking while preserving the working viewport rendering from commit `020b12541b95f46cc9eebf6188f9270b2bdf8a3a`.

## Changes Made

### 1. designStore.ts - Backward Compatible API
**File**: `frontend/static/src/store/designStore.ts`

**Changes**:
- Made `loadGLBModel` accept optional parameters: `(modelPath?, modelName?, sourceOverride?)`
- Smart source resolution with explicit priority:
  1. Explicit `sourceOverride` parameter (when provided)
  2. Path detection (checks for `/uploaded/` in URL)
  3. Default fallback to `'ai'`
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing AI pipeline calls without args work unchanged
- **New Upload Flow**: Upload flow explicitly passes `'uploaded'` as third parameter

**Benefits**:
- No breaking changes to existing AI generation code
- Clean separation between AI and uploaded models
- Explicit source tracking for better UX

### 2. AIChatSidebar.tsx - Lightweight Upload Integration
**File**: `frontend/static/src/components/AIChatSidebar/AIChatSidebar.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Upload section remains gated behind toggle button
- When uploader is closed, full chat UI is visible (no disruption)
- `handleUploadSuccess` explicitly calls `actions.loadGLBModel(modelUrl, modelName, 'uploaded')`
- Upload messages provide clear feedback in chat history

**UI Flow**:
1. Default state: Full chat interface visible
2. Click "üìÅ Upload Model": Shows uploader, hides chat temporarily
3. After upload: Auto-closes uploader, returns to chat view
4. Success message appears in chat history

**Benefits**:
- Maintains clean chat UX that commit `020b125` restored
- Upload is available but not intrusive
- Clear visual feedback for both upload states

### 3. GLBModel.tsx - Feature-Flagged Material Enhancements
**File**: `frontend/static/src/components/GLBModel/GLBModel.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Material enhancements (clearcoat, metalness adjustments) now gated by:
  ```typescript
  const shouldEnhanceMaterials = featureFlags.enableJewelryMaterialEnhancements && source === 'uploaded'
  ```
- Base enhancement (envMapIntensity) scaled based on flag:
  - Enhanced mode: `2.0`
  - Default mode: `1.5`
- Shadows always enabled (non-breaking enhancement)

**Benefits**:
- Conservative defaults preserve working viewport
- Jewelry-specific enhancements available via feature flag
- Only applies to uploaded models when enabled
- Easy to A/B test different rendering approaches

### 4. SceneOutliner.tsx - Safe Metadata Display
**File**: `frontend/static/src/components/SceneOutliner/SceneOutliner.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Source badge display with safe fallback:
  ```typescript
  const source = model.source ?? (model.url?.includes('/uploaded/') ? 'uploaded' : 'ai')
  ```
- Icon display: `üìÅ` for uploaded, `ü§ñ` for AI
- Badge classes apply conditionally
- Fixed emoji character encoding issue

**Benefits**:
- Graceful handling of models without explicit source
- Visual distinction between AI and uploaded models
- No rendering errors if metadata missing
- Existing CSS already supports badges

## Feature Flags Configuration

**File**: `frontend/static/src/config/featureFlags.ts`

Current settings (conservative):
```typescript
export const featureFlags = {
  enableJewelryMaterialEnhancements: false,  // Off by default
  enableHighFidelityViewportLighting: false  // Off by default
} as const
```

**To enable jewelry enhancements**:
```typescript
enableJewelryMaterialEnhancements: true
```

This will apply enhanced materials (clearcoat, adjusted metalness/roughness) to uploaded models only.

## Testing Checklist

### Critical Path (Must Not Break)
- [ ] AI generation via chat still works
- [ ] Generated models render in viewport
- [ ] Camera controls work (orbit, zoom, pan)
- [ ] Layer detection and selection work
- [ ] Scene outliner shows AI models correctly

### Upload Flow (New Integration)
- [ ] Upload button appears in sidebar
- [ ] Click opens uploader, hides chat
- [ ] File upload succeeds
- [ ] Model appears in viewport
- [ ] Source badge shows "Uploaded" with üìÅ icon
- [ ] Uploader auto-closes after success
- [ ] Chat messages confirm upload

### Backward Compatibility
- [ ] Old AI-generated models (without source) render
- [ ] Models from before this change display correctly
- [ ] No console errors about missing metadata
- [ ] Scene outliner infers source correctly

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, revert these specific changes:

1. **designStore.ts**: Restore previous `loadGLBModel` signature
2. **AIChatSidebar.tsx**: Remove upload section entirely
3. **GLBModel.tsx**: Remove feature flag checks, apply enhancements unconditionally
4. **SceneOutliner.tsx**: Remove source badge rendering

All changes are isolated and can be reverted independently.

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 (When Stable)
1. Enable `enableJewelryMaterialEnhancements` by default
2. Add upload history/gallery
3. Model format conversion feedback
4. Upload progress indicators

### Phase 3 (Advanced)
1. Custom lighting presets per model
2. Material override UI
3. Batch upload support
4. Cloud storage integration

## Commit Reference

**Working baseline**: `020b12541b95f46cc9eebf6188f9270b2bdf8a3a`
- This commit had working viewport rendering
- Our changes preserve all working functionality
- Only additive enhancements applied

## Notes

- All material enhancements are **opt-in** via feature flags
- Upload flow is **non-intrusive** to chat UX
- Source tracking is **backward compatible**
- No changes to Viewport.tsx (preserves working render logic)
